Global configuration
--------------------

The library has a number of configuration settings it can read from
the configuration database (for tools and servers) or from the properties
file (for drivers)

repository.basedir	
	when new repositories are created, they should be added to this
	directory

repository.default
	The default repository where to place images taken during guiding

service.name
	The service name the snowstar server shoul use

service.port
	The port on which the snowstar server is supposed to listen

service.sslport
	The TLS port on which the snowstar server is supposed to listen


Device properties
-----------------

Device properties provide additional information to the drivers. For devices
with a serial port, they map the device name to the serial port to use
to communicate with the device. The format of these properties is alwas

    <devicename> <propertyname> = <value>

The following properties are used in some of the drivers:

Celestron driver:

The Celestron driver needs a serial device for communication. The device
name is not in any way discoverable, so it needs to be configured in the
properties file. The mount with the device URL mount:celestron/<unit> looks
for the serial device path in preoprty "mount:celestron/<unit> device"


Starlight Express driver:

Starlight Express adaptive optics units use a serial port for communication.
The units are named "adaptiveoptics:sx/<unit>", where <unit> is the
unit number (0 to 3). The serial device to use is found in the property
named "device", i.e. an entry of the form

	adaptiveoptics:sx/0 device = /dev/tty.KeySerial1

is needed.
