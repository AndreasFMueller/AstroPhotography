configuration system:

      -	configuration system should use only one table for all domains
      - configurations should be ICE accessible

Image:
      - FITS write operation has setPrecious/precious accessors that should
	be unified
      - Bug in attribute read routines: if headers are in a second hdu, then
	they are ignored

URLs:
      - give every component an URL by which it can be identified
      - create classes to connect to any component by URL
      - convert the net driver from CORBA to ZeroC (or create a new
	driver, e.g. called nice ;-)

Instruments:
      - add instrument implementation to the ICE server
