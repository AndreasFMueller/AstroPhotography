configuration system:

Devices:
      -	GuiderPort -> GuidePort
      -	reservation of devices to ensure that a CCD e.g. used for guiging
	is not used for other exposures at the same time
      -	query method to ask for the most recent problem with a device
      -	Camera: query method to ask whether the most recent exposure was
	successful
      -	Warmup feature (for ATIK cameras)
      - Some CCDs have different modes (download speed, image quality,
	whether or not to turn of the amplifier to prevent amplifier bloom),
	which should be made available through the CCD interface

Guiding:
      -	Missing configuration itmes should result in useful error messages
      -	transfer mount position data into the calibration
      -	bright stars that appear in the field of view during calibration
	lead to problems.
      -	Crash during camera initialization cause nonrecoverable errors in
	calibration and guiding. In general, failures in those threads should
	be handled more gracefully
      - reservation of relevant devices during calibraiton and guiding

Image:
      - FITS write operation has setPrecious/precious accessors that should
	be unified
      - Bug in attribute read routines: if headers are in a second hdu, then
	they are ignored
      - logic of precious is flawed

URLs:

Instruments:
      - If an ICE instrument changes, but the guider derived from it has
	already been used, the changes become effective only after a restart
	of the server
      - Query method to ask whether an instrument has sufficient configuration
	for a purpose. E.g. calibration needs focal length and possibly
	guide speed for calibration, but non of these for guiding.

Drivers:
      - When there is a problem with the SX camera, we should try to reset
	the camera and retry the operation. It should not be necessary to
	disconnect and reconnect the camera to reset it.
      -	It should be possible to reread the devices of a module, just in
	case a new device was added during runtime.

ICE client/server:
      - USB Timeout in a driver should always be converted to a decent timeout
	exception sent back to the client and hopefully handled there
      -	shutter option f√ºr snowtask.cpp

General:
      - Template class with variadic constructor for throwing exceptions
	(doing the usual msg = stringprintf, debug(LOG_ERR,...) and throw
	all at once by simply instatiating the template).
