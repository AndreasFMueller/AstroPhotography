configuration system:

      -	configuration system should use only one table for all domains
      - configurations should be ICE accessible

Guiding:
      -	get focal length from instrument

Image:
      - FITS write operation has setPrecious/precious accessors that should
	be unified
      - Bug in attribute read routines: if headers are in a second hdu, then
	they are ignored
      - logic of precious is flawed

URLs:
      - give every component an URL by which it can be identified
      - create classes to connect to any component by URL
      - convert the net driver from CORBA to ZeroC (or create a new
	driver, e.g. called nice ;-)

Instruments:
      - add instrument implementation to the ICE server
      -	add properties to instruments, e.g. for focal length of camera and
	guider

Drivers:
      - SX driver is rather unstable with the Trius SX-16 camera. There are
	often timeouts, may be race conditions with the cooler?
      -	SX driver should never crash the ICE server (which it seems to do in
	some cases with the Trius SX-16)
      -	Are the timeouts always set in the USB calls with the SX cameras?
      - When there is a problem with the SX camera, we should try to reset
	the camera and retry the operation. It should not be necessary to
	disconnect and reconnect the camera to reset it.

ICE server:
      - USB Timeout in a driver should always be converted to a decent timeout
	exception sent back to the client and hopefully handled there
