configuration system:

Pointing:
      - azimuth not evaluated

Devices:
      -	reservation of devices to ensure that a CCD e.g. used for guiging
	is not used for other exposures at the same time
      -	query method to ask for the most recent problem with a device
      -	Camera: query method to ask whether the most recent exposure was
	successful
      -	Warmup feature (for ATIK cameras)
      - Some CCDs have different modes (download speed, image quality,
	whether or not to turn of the amplifier to prevent amplifier bloom),
	which should be made available through the CCD interface
      - Need minimum/maximum exposure time for gui (make available through
	properties?)
      - Need snow* tools for cooler, filterwheel, ccd, all with monitoring
	capability to test callback functionality

Guiding:
      -	Missing configuration itmes should result in useful error messages
      -	transfer mount position data into the calibration
      -	bright stars that appear in the field of view during calibration
	lead to problems.
      -	Crash during camera initialization cause nonrecoverable errors in
	calibration and guiding. In general, failures in those threads should
	be handled more gracefully
      - reservation of relevant devices during calibraiton and guiding
      - during guiding, should we introduce a damping factor to prevent 
	oscillations at the price of somewhat slower corrections?
      - Preparation of calibration, in particular computation of the grid
	constant should happen earlier, so that we can throw a useful
	exception already in the startCalibration call.
      - All calls should test whether the instrument is really available
	and throw a useful exception for the user (particularly important
	for calls via ICE)
      - Communicator cleanup when the snowguide utility exits

Focusing:
      - FWHM does not work reliably

Image:
      - FITS write operation has setPrecious/precious accessors that should
	be unified
      - Bug in attribute read routines: if headers are in a second hdu, then
	they are ignored
      - logic of precious is flawed
      - If an image has an RGB mosaic, and we take a subframe, what 
	mosaic do we actually give the subframe?

Tasks:
      -	deadlock in the task manager thread startup
      - dark images on atik camera are take with shutter open
      - cannot use tasks when imaging with instrument without imager

URLs:

Instruments:
      - If an ICE instrument changes, but the guider derived from it has
	already been used, the changes become effective only after a restart
	of the server
      - Query method to ask whether an instrument has sufficient configuration
	for a purpose. E.g. calibration needs focal length and possibly
	guide speed for calibration, but non of these for guiding.

Drivers:
      - When there is a problem with the SX camera, we should try to reset
	the camera and retry the operation. It should not be necessary to
	disconnect and reconnect the camera to reset it.
      -	It should be possible to reread the devices of a module, just in
	case a new device was added during runtime.
      -	othello focuser seems to fail very often, maybe need update of 
	firmware

ICE client/server:
      - USB Timeout in a driver should always be converted to a decent timeout
	exception sent back to the client and hopefully handled there
      -	shutter option f√ºr snowtask.cpp

Catalog:
      -	Why is precession in Hipparcos catalog not needed?

General:
      - Template class with variadic constructor for throwing exceptions
	(doing the usual msg = stringprintf, debug(LOG_ERR,...) and throw
	all at once by simply instatiating the template).

Hardware:
      - Label Cameras with up direction so that pointing becomes easier.
