\chapter{Guiding\label{chapter:guiding}}
The \texttt{Guider} class is by far the most complicated class in the
system.
It contains everything needed to perform guiding of a telescope 
using a guide port or an adaptive optics unit, or both.

\section{Naming}
Each guider has a name that identifies the instrument and the instrument
components the guider is built from.
The format of the name is
\[
\langle\textit{instrumentname}\rangle
\texttt{|}
\langle\textit{ccdIndex}\rangle
\texttt{|}
\langle\textit{guiderportIndex}\rangle
\texttt{|}
\langle\textit{adaptiveopticsIndex}\rangle
\]
The index fields indicate the index of the components of the appropriate
type in the instrument.
If some component is unused, its place in the name string is left empty.
The class \texttt{astro::guiding::GuiderName} encapsulates guider names,
and internally sets unused components to $-1$.
