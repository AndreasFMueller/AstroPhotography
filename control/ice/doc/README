How to compile ZeroC ICE for use with AstroPhotography

Distributions usually come with old versions of ICE and
it needs to be compiled for the current system.

0. Debian: install additional dependencies

	libmccp-dev
	libbz2-dev
	liblmdb-dev

1. get the source

	git clone https://github.com/zeroc-ice/ice

2. (Macos) The default make rules for Macos turn deprecation warnings
   into errors, which causes the build to fail. To fix this, remove
   -Wdeprecated from the cppflags definition in ice/config/Make.rules.Darwin
   also remove the -Werror, because there are other warnings that would
   prevent compilation

3. modify the scripts to
   a) include the correct installation directory
   b) use all available cores

4. Compile:

	bash ice.build

5. Install:

	bash ice.install
