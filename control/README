This Project allows to control astrophotographic cameras and accessories
and delivers a framework to build astrophotography tools.

This is an autotools and libtool based package. To build it, make sure
you have installed have installed autotools and libtool. Then create
the build files using

	$ libtoolize -f
	$ aclocal
	$ autoheader
	$ automake -a -c
	$ autoconf

Then configure the package using the included configureit script. This
script sets some configure options useful for debugging and development,
e.g. it configures it to install in the directory root. Some tests
expect it to be installed there.

The project depends on the following external packages to compile.

Mandatory packages:

 - CPPUnit: Unit testing framework for C++, available on SourceFoge:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/

 - Cfitsio: C-Library to manipulate FITS files, available from the
   NASA web site: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
   The website also has links to online documentation here:
