This Project allows to control astrophotographic cameras and accessories
and delivers a framework to build astrophotography tools.

This is an autotools and libtool based package. To build it, make sure
you have installed have installed autotools and libtool. Then create
the build files using

	$ libtoolize -f
	$ aclocal
	$ autoheader
	$ automake -a -c
	$ autoconf

Then configure the package using the included configureit script. This
script sets some configure options useful for debugging and development,
e.g. it configures it to install in the directory root. Some tests
expect it to be installed there.

The project depends on the following external packages to compile.

Mandatory packages:

 - libusb: this is a common package on all Linux systems, but Mac OS X
   users will have to download from http://www.libusb.org and compile
   themselves. For Mac OS X, libusb 1.0.16 (release candidate at least 10,
   previous versions cannot call libusb_context twice) or newer must be
   used, as previous versions have bugs that cause the software to fail
   on that plattform.

 - CPPUnit: Unit testing framework for C++, available on SourceFoge:
   http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/

 - Cfitsio: C-Library to manipulate FITS files, available from the
   NASA web site: http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio/
   The website also has links to online documentation here:
   http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/software/fitsio/c/c_user/cfitsio.html

 - LAPACK: in several places, linear systems of equations and least squares
   problems for relatively large numbers of equations or unknowns need to
   be solved. For these operations, LAPACK is used.

 - omniORB: The client-server-communication uses Corba, and the build system
   assumes that omniORB is preinstalled for the purpose.

 - GLPK, the GNU Linear Programming toolKit. This package is used for the
   algorithm that finds a background to subtract.

Optional packages:

 - Unicap: on Linux, accessing USB Video class cameras is simplified
   by using the Video4Linux and the Unicap library. See
   http://unicap-imaging.org

 - SBIG driver library. Astrophotography cameras by SBIG are supported
   via the SBIG driver library, which can be obtained from the SBIG
   website.
