USB memory size issue on Linux
------------------------------

On Linux, there is an issue with the transfer size for large images.
The default maximum memory size for USB transfers in the kernel is
set to 16MB, as can be read from

/sys/module/usbcore/parameters/usbfs_memory_mb

To increase the memory size, one has to write the memory size to
this sys filesystem node. This can be automated and done from within
the udev rules. See the file 80-sx.rules in this directory for
instructions how to set up udev to automaticall set the memory size.
