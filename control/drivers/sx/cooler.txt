Here's Dave's answer on the cooler -

Andreas is correct the first function "SX_CMD_COOLER" works as he
describes it.

The second function "SX_CMD_COOLER_TEMPERATURE" is used just to
return the cooler temperature & status. It cannot change the cooler
set point. Originally only the first function was available but
some customers did not like the idea of setting the cooler operating
point each time they wanted to know the current temperature. So a
simpler function was introduced to do this.
