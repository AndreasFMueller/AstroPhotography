This directory contains source code for the driver for the new QHYCCD 
cameras like the 60 Mpixel camera QHY600. It is based on QHYCCds own
library.


There are some errors in the API

- the argument to the function OpenQHYCCD(char *camid) should be declared
  const, or does the function actually modify the name of the device
  when it opens it. This seems highly illogical, because it would mean
  that the device can later no longer be found because it has changed
  name.

- a libqhyccd.la file is not provided, but would be very helpful to make
  platform independent linking easier

- apparently it is not possible to turn off the cooler except by setting
  the set temperature to environment temperature

- the guide port is detected on the QHY600C allthough that camera does
  not have a guide port

TODO

- gain curves are available in the online documentation and give some
  insight into the meaning of the values

- It is not possible to read the gain values, so the driver has to take
  care of this. The recommended initial gain setting seems to be camera
  dependent, so the constructor may have to take care of this.

- The QHY600 camera has four different readout modes. Readout modes
  may change the available size of the device, so we have no choice but
  to add the readout mode to the device path name:

     ccd:qhy2/cameraname/readout0/8
     ccd:qhy2/cameraname/readout1/8
     ccd:qhy2/cameraname/readout2/8
     ccd:qhy2/cameraname/readout3/8
     ccd:qhy2/cameraname/readout0/16
     ccd:qhy2/cameraname/readout1/16
     ccd:qhy2/cameraname/readout2/16
     ccd:qhy2/cameraname/readout3/16
