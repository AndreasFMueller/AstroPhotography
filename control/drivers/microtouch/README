The MicroTouch focuser motor product uses a unipolar stepper motor
PFC25-24D1G from Nippon Pulse (NPM). The designation means that the
motor has a diameter of 25mm, and performs 24 steps for a turn.
The coil resistance is 16 ohms, and it is to be driven with a coil
current of about 300mA.

The MicroTouch focuser driving hardware drives the motor as a unipolar
motor, but our own hardware uses a bipolar Pololu driver. Unfortunately,
the two center terminals of the motor coils are connected inside the
motor housing, which makes it necessary to open the housing and cut a
trace on the board that connects the connector to the motor.

For bipolar operation, it is necessary to cut the trace between 3 and 4.
Then 1-5 and 2-6 can be used as bipolar coils. These are the pairs 3-4
and 5-6 on the modular jack.
