When testing The Imaging Source cameras, it can be useful to force 
the uvc driver to use it. This can be accomplished by explicitely telling
the driver to accept the VID:PID of the camera:

    echo 199e 8101 > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/uvcvideo/new_id

It should then be recognized as a video camera and vlc can use it
