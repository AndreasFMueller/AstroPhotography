This directory contains IDL and supporting definitions for CORBA services

Why CORBA is used:

- with omniORB we have a very efficient ORB implementation that can easily
  transport complicated binary data structures. This means that there
  is no serious penalty in using CORBA instead of the native classes.

- The IDL we use is very close to the native classes.  The servant classes
  are really just rather simple wrappers around the native classes.
  On the client side, the application logic hardly changes when converting
  an application to CORBA

- Using SSL certificates, it is also quite simple to implement strong
  security if needed
