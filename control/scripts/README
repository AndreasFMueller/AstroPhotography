This directory contains scripts for starting/stopping the server

init.d:

	create a start script that calls /usr/local/astro/etc/startastro

systemd:

	1. install snowstar.service in /lib/systemd/system
	2. systemctl daemon-reload
	3. systemctl enable snowstar.service
	4. systemctl start snowstar.service

Some other changes to system configuration may be useful.

- some more complicated changes are described in individual README
  files in this directory:

	README.database		install the initial database
	README.images		set up the image repository
	README.log		setting up logging
	README.repo		automatically mount a USB stick on the
				repo directory
	README.starcatalogs	making star catalogs available, mainly
				for the simulator driver

- sudo

When logging into the system via the network during a cold night, it is
nice if you can do most things with as few keystrokes as possible. Not
needing to give a password to sudo is one of those time savers. Add a line

	astro	ALL=(ALL:ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

to allow the astro user to become root without a password. Of course this
is not a terribly secure configuration, but out in the field this is
probably a lesser concern.
