ccdcontrollerwidget:
      -	allow for the subframe stuff to be disabled and hidden
      -	add gain and offset controls
      -	add controls for image quality and other special properties that
	depend on the camera. They should only be visible for cameras that
	have them

guidercontrollerwidget:
      -	read star point on startup, if the server already has one
      - Display calibration after calibration completes
      - Allow to view calibration details during guiding, e.g. by letting
	the Points button enabled
      - "Points" -> "Details", create a dialog that shows the calibration
	details and all the points
      - the CalibrattionDisplayWidget should be able to optionally label
	the points with numbers so that the calibration detail dialog
	can refer to them from the list of points
      -	Database button is not needed, we should create a separate subapp
	designed to inspect tracks and their calibrations
      - when guiding is in progress, the ccd, guiderport and filterwheel
	controls should be completely disabled (cooler is OK, as it does
	usually not interfere with the calibration/guiding
      -	for large guide methods it should be possible to scale the image 
	in the tracking monitor down, i.e. negative scale steps should be
	possible (maybe the initial size should be such that the image
	fits into the frame, and the user can then step up, but at large
	scales, only the central part of the image will be displayed)

trackingmonitorwindow:
      - scrolling in long histories
      -	synchronize AO and GP histories (currently the scale is steps, not
	time, but AO usually has a much shorter time scale)

guidingwindow:
      -	adaptiveoptics tool missing

adaptiveopticscontrollerwidget:
      - missing

coolercontrollerwidget:
      -	add an indicator that shows whether the temperature is still changing
	or has already been reached
      - actual temperature should not allow selection
      -	if the set temperature is changed, but no set, it should return
	to the actual set temperature after a few seconds. Or there needs
	to be a display for the actual set temperature, and the new set
	temperature, or changeing the set temperature immediately sets it,
	this would remove the need for the "set" button

focusercontrollerwidget:
      -	indicator for a moving focuser (the disable move button is just not
	visible enough)
      -	the allowed focuser range should be displayed
