Upgrading the Qt version
------------------------

When upgradeing the Qt version on MacOS, do the following:

1. update configureit and environment to set the path to the new
directory, typically /Applications/Qt5/Qt5.14

2. remove all the Makefiles generated from .pro files. They still
contain the path to the old version of qmake and will not be
regenerated automatically. You can use the cleanmakefiles script
to do this.

3. run configureit. This will rebuild all the .pro files. Run make,
this will rebuild all the Makefiles
