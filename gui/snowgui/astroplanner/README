AstroPlanner

The astroplanner application helps plan astrophotographic campaigns.
It needs the following information:

1. Location of the user or observatory.

2. Planned observation time.

3. Information about telescopes and cameras, in particular about focal length
of the telescope and the sensor sizes.

3. (optional) information about the horizon at the location of the 
observatory.

The following information can then be obtained from the planner:

- rise and set time, taking the horizon into account
- culmination time
- maximum elevation
- what can be seen on a chip?
- print charts of environment of the target in various devices, e.g. the
finder, the guider and the imager, even a telrad image
