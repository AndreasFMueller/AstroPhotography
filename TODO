- when opening the backlash dialog for the first time:

	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] backlashdialog.cpp:094: identity: 922BBA9F-E15B-484B-AF57-C382EFFEA143
	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] ChannelDisplayWidget.cpp:091: plotting between inf and -inf (-inf seconds)
	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] ChannelDisplayWidget.cpp:096: duration must be positive

- the graph of the backlash analysis needs a legend

- calibration thread termination not correctly signaled to application

- accept reason strings the payload data in endCallback

- track display needs a legend (ra = blue, dec = green)

- Ubuntu GUI: where is the file menu?

- repositories should be relative to a path stored in the repository database

- tasks should be stored in a database that is in the same place as the
  repository stuff, i.e. on the USB stick
