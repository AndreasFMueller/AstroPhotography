- when opening the backlash dialog for the first time:

	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] backlashdialog.cpp:094: identity: 922BBA9F-E15B-484B-AF57-C382EFFEA143
	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] ChannelDisplayWidget.cpp:091: plotting between inf and -inf (-inf seconds)
	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] ChannelDisplayWidget.cpp:096: duration must be positive

- the graph of the backlash analysis needs a legend

- calibration thread termination not correctly signaled to application

- accept reason strings the payload data in endCallback

- track display needs a legend (ra = blue, dec = green)

- Ubuntu GUI: where is the file menu?

- tasks should be stored in a database that is in the same place as the
  repository stuff, i.e. on the USB stick

8. 10.

- ATIK camera does not work with linux

- Focuser not recognized

- remote Guideport leads to crashes when guiding (works when the client
  talks to the process directly)

- task application does not start

- tasks submitted immediately go to failed status

- no events generated when a task starts up and fails

- RA/DEC tooltip in telescope position west wrong should be reversed

- SX Trius 16 behaves strangely with after images

- guideport monitoring should not be done with polling, but with callbacks

- cooler monitoring should be done with polling, but with callbacks

- camera status changes should use callbacks

- star chart reloads too frequently

- threading problems in all GUI applications, make sure connections
  use queuing

- Make othello guideport driver more robust: reset connection if device
  has gone away. Just pretend to the client that the device is there and
  try to reestablish the connection.

- how can we debug segmentation faults in the server?

- image retrieval leads to beachball of terror

- increase number of client threads

- position corrections should be possible with the guide port, this of course
  depends on correct orientation of the camera

- comparision between star chart and imager picture should be available to
  simplify pointing
