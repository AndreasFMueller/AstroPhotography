- table structure

- during guiding

	$ stacktrace caused by signal 11
	[0] /usr/local/astro/lib/libastro.so.0(stderr_stacktrace+0x3b) [0xb6f447c4]
	[1] /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libc.so.6(+0x25260) [0xb6164260]

- should be handled more elegantly

	-! 04/08/18 07:18:42.206 warning: dispatch exception: std::exception: cannot start guiding in this state

- when opening the backlash dialog for the first time:

	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] backlashdialog.cpp:094: identity: 922BBA9F-E15B-484B-AF57-C382EFFEA143
	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] ChannelDisplayWidget.cpp:091: plotting between inf and -inf (-inf seconds)
	Apr 13 13:58:43 snowgui[8515/1] ChannelDisplayWidget.cpp:096: duration must be positive

- the graph of the backlash analysis needs a legend

- calibration thread termination not correctly signaled to application

- accept reason strings the payload data in endCallback

- track display needs a legend (ra = blue, dec = green)

- Ubuntu GUI: where is the file menu?
