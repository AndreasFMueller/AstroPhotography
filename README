This repository contains a set of projects used to build astrophotography
tools for Unix. There are some open source tools available, but they usually
have at least one of the following problems:

- They are too complex for a casual user. IRAF is an example for this.

- They only support a very limited class of cameras. There are hardly
  any tools that can, with suitable drivers of course, work with any
  camera.

- Distributed architecture. This system is geared towards a distributed
  application using a network. It allows to have small computers on telescopes
  and mounts and to control everything from a WiFi connected notebook
  computer. This eliminates all potentially flexing cables (except power)
  and thus image shifts and bad contacts.

This repository contains the following components:

1. Control: A library written that provides access to cameras and accessories.
   The library allows to dynamically load a driver module. The driver module
   provides some factory functions to retrieve objects representing cameras,
   ccds, filterwheels or other acessories. This allows to write generic
   applications that work with all supported cameras. The library includes
   support for USB cameras from The Imaging Source, ans Starlight Express
   and Cameras supported by the universal driver library from SBIG. Other
   modules can easily be added.

2. gui: Some gui components usefull to build complete GUI applications

3. Focus: This directory contains applications for focus control, based on
   the Control library.

4. Guiding: Some applications useful for guiding
