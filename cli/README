Command line interface for camera control, some ideas what we might
want to implement

1. data types

- numbers
- strings
- images
- image sets
- exposure definitions

2. operations

- arithmetic operations for numbers
- standard functions
- string concatenation and formatting
- arithmetic operations with images and constants
- average, median, maximum, minimum of a set of images
- debayering operations on imges
- composition of images
- conversion RGB -> luminance
- subimage
- artificially binned image

3. control structures

- for-loop for a sequence of values
- for-loop for an image set
- conditional execution (if-then-else-endif)

4. functions (optional)

- function definitions

5. various

- reading extern files (source command)
- error handling (do not execute anything in a statement that is 
  syntactically incorrect)
