This directory contains small prototype developments that will never
make it into the main branch, so that it doesn't make sense to plan
for a merge.

An example would be the development of a new derotation algorithm
based on the Radon transform. This experiment uses OpenCV and many
other libraries in a rather unsystematic way. It might be better
to reimplement some of OpenCVs functionality in a more robust way,
or use more lightweight libraries.  For prototyping, however, it
is usefull to have a more comprehensive library.

(e.g. in OpenCV, accessing array elements via typed accessor functions
only works if the programmer chooses the right type. This is not
what I expect from a well designed Library. Probably OpenCV should
implement adapter classes that allow one to access and modify pixels
of an 8bit image just as if they were floats).
